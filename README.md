# Identification Station
Repository for the CMGT kick off gamejam of the 2024-2025 academic year.  

The game was developed in under 48 hours by [S4lt1](https://github.com/FreekPluim), [TheSoupWizard](https://www.artstation.com/thesoupwizard) and [Sad-AI](https://github.com/Sad-AI-dev)
 for the CMGT kick off gamejam.  
All shown assets were created within the time frame of the game jam, except for the music, sounds and fonts.  
The game has been published on [itch](https://sad-ai.itch.io/identification-station), where it can be played in a browser, or downloaded as a standalone executable.  
The theme for the jam was `Identity` which inspired us to make a game about *identifying* the *identity* of various silly magic items.
